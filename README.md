Similar to the watchlist project but with many more features. 
Also, more modular, as it is programmed in an object oriented way.

Requires redis to pub/sub quotes in real time or playback. Historical data and meta-data
are stored in kdb. 
Several libraries are used, please see the jtrdr_lib directory for a detailed list.
Eclipse project file is provided but can be built from the command line as well.
